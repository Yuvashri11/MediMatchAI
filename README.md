**Problem Statement
In applications like MedPlus (a pharmacy/medical app), users manually enter tablet names to place orders. This process is error-prone and time-consuming, especially when dealing with handwritten prescriptions. Misinterpretation of medicine names or dosages can lead to severe consequences, such as incorrect orders or health risks. The goal is to automate this process by allowing users to upload an image of a handwritten prescription, which will then be automatically converted to text using a highly precise handwriting recognition system.**
